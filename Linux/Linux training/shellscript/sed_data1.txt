<title>About the Web</title>

<para>
This is an article about the World Wide Web.
The World Wide Web is a collection of documents that are linked to
one another. The Web is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the same as the
Internet. The Internet is a world-wide network of networks, and it
does far more than simply serve up Web pages.

emphasis on the portability of web pages. Rather than create a
proprietary format, he made Web pages dependent only upon plain ASCII
text.</para>

&lt;li&gt;Set up your directories on Windows. This is
where you will write your HTML documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</listing>

<para>It looks difficult, but it is possible to learn HTML in a few
weeks. <emphasis>You, too can create web pages for viewing by
friends and family!</emphasis>
Note that, in our listing, we had to encode &gt; as &amp;gt.
